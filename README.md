In today's class we have learned how to access the DOM (Document Object Model) and manipulate it using JavaScript. We have learned how to access elements by their id, class, tag name using the querySelector. We have also learned how to create new elements and append them to the DOM.

Each folder has the code of each part of the lesson.
